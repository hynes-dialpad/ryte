## Optional Controlled Recovery Check

Only run this if the tester explicitly chooses to exercise database recovery. Back up the local index database first, use a synthetic or disposable app data directory when practical, and do not commit database files.

| Check                                       | Result  | Notes                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Malformed local index database is recovered | Not run | Covered by automated recovery tests; optional manual recovery was not exercised. |

## Follow-Ups

Record any failures here with a short description and the target follow-up phase or PR.

- Phase 0 manual smoke used only synthetic notes and an isolated Electron user data directory.
- Live cloud answer streaming and live provider/model API failure checks remain follow-ups because they require intentional cloud provider use.
