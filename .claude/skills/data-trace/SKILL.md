# Ryte Data Trace

Map a feature's source of truth and lifecycle without inspecting private note content.

## Workflow

1. Classify the target as renderer state, IPC, settings, workspace persistence, SQLite/vector index, file event, provider state, or derived display value.
2. Trace the real path from user action or source event through ownership, persistence, invalidation, and rendered consumer.
3. Identify the source of truth, derived values, write authority, update fan-out, and recovery behavior.
4. Check for renderer ownership bypasses, persisted derived state, stale reads, duplicate notifications, cross-window leakage, and incomplete schema or migration coverage.
5. Validate the narrow contract with focused tests and synthetic cross-process reproduction where relevant.

## Output

Report the data map, file evidence, source of truth, invalidation path, findings, and open questions.
