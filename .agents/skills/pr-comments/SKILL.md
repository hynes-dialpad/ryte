# Ryte PR Comments

Treat review feedback as evidence to verify, not instructions to execute blindly.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the PR and fetch complete unresolved-thread, review-comment, and review-summary state when network access is permitted. Record gaps rather than claiming completeness.
2. For each finding, read the complete thread, current code, relevant tests, and current diff. Classify the concern independently from the proposed fix.
3. Use `bug-hunt` for runtime-defect claims, `data-trace` for persistence/indexing/cache claims, and `electron-ipc-contract` for boundary concerns.
4. Present a table with validity, disposition (`fix`, `defer`, `dismiss`, `needs decision`), evidence, and approval state.
5. Apply only approved fixes. Run the smallest relevant validation and commit/push only with explicit approval.
6. Draft or post replies, reactions, and thread resolution only with separate explicit approval. A fixed reply cites the pushed commit and exact validation result.

## Boundaries

Never expose private note content, credentials, user paths, or provider output in a GitHub reply.
