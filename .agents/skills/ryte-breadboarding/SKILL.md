description: Breadboard and slice Ryte feature work after shaping or when mapping an existing Ryte workflow. Use when the user wants UI affordance tables, code affordance tables, wiring diagrams, vertical implementation slices, shell/viewer/search flow maps, or a meticulous implementation plan for a selected Ryte shape.

# Ryte Breadboarding

Use this skill to map a selected Ryte shape into concrete affordances, wiring, and demoable vertical slices.

## Ground Rules

- Tables are the source of truth. Diagrams are optional views derived from the tables.
- Every slice must end in visible, demoable app behavior.
- Avoid horizontal slices like "add all data models" or "refactor all CSS" unless they are hidden work inside a vertical slice.
- Preserve Ryte architecture boundaries:
  - Main process owns filesystem, SQLite/vector storage, providers, credentials, external links, and OS integration.
  - Preload exposes narrow typed operations.
  - Renderer owns UI state and calls preload APIs.
- Keep local-first behavior intact. Do not introduce network, sync, or provider calls unless the selected shape explicitly requires them.
- Use synthetic fixtures or UI smoke checks; do not validate against real note content unless explicitly approved.

## Breadboard Inputs

Start from one of:

- A selected shape from `ryte-shaping`
- A rough design with enough decisions to map
- An existing workflow that needs to be understood before changing it

If the input has unresolved `UNKNOWN` mechanisms, convert them into spikes before slicing unless the user asks for a provisional breadboard.

## Places

Group affordances by place. For Ryte, common places are:

- `P1 App Shell`
- `P2 Sidebar Navigation`
- `P3 Tab Strip`
- `P4 Command/Open View`
- `P5 Library View`
- `P6 Viewer Preview`
- `P7 Viewer Source`
- `P8 Settings`
- `P9 Main Process`
- `P10 Preload API`
- `S1 Local UI State`
- `S2 Local Persistence`
- `S3 SQLite Index`
- `S4 macOS Window`

Add or rename places to match the shaped feature. Stores use `S#`; screens/components/process boundaries use `P#`.

## UI Affordance Table

Use this format:

```markdown
## UI Affordances

| ID  | Place                 | Affordance   | Action / Display        | Wires Out | Returns To |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| U1  | P2 Sidebar Navigation | Library item | Opens all-files library | U1 -> U8  | P5         |
```

Include things the user can see, click, type into, toggle, collapse, select, close, or read. Skip purely decorative wrappers unless they control layout state.

## Code Affordance Table

Use this format:

```markdown
## Code Affordances

| ID  | Place             | Affordance | Responsibility                                     | Wires Out | Returns To |
| --- | ----------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| C1  | S1 Local UI State | tab store  | Tracks open tabs, active tab, close/select actions | C1 -> C4  | P3         |
```

Include state stores, IPC handlers, parser functions, persistence operations, main-process services, and preload API calls that are meaningful affordances. Do not create rows for internal helper details unless they carry a decision, side effect, or integration boundary.

## Wiring Rules

- Use IDs in `Wires Out`, for example `U4 -> C3 -> C7 -> S2`.
- Use `Returns To` for the place or affordance the user sees after completion.
- Show both navigation flow and data flow when they differ.
- Represent external/local stores explicitly, for example `localStorage`, Ryte settings JSON, SQLite, or Electron BrowserWindow state.
- If a wire crosses renderer/preload/main, make the boundary visible in the code affordance table.

## Optional Mermaid View

Only add a Mermaid diagram after the tables are coherent.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  U1[Sidebar Library] --> U8[Library View]
  U8 --> C1[Open File Handler]
  C1 --> S1[Tab Store]
```

If the user changes the diagram, update the tables first and regenerate the diagram from them.

## Slicing

After the breadboard is stable, create vertical slices.

Slice format:

```markdown
## Slice V1: [Title]

### Demo

[What the user can see or do after this slice.]

### Included Affordances

- U1, U2, C1, C2, S1

### Implementation Notes

- [Files/modules likely touched]

### Validation

- [Automated checks]
- [Manual smoke]

### Out of Scope

- [Explicitly excluded work]
```

Slicing guidelines:

- Start with the minimum shell that proves the new state model.
- Prefer slices that can merge independently.
- Put risky unknowns before dependent polish.
- Keep labels, profile, agents, sync, writable editing, and provider behavior out unless selected by the shape.
- Include docs/version/progress-note updates in the final or relevant slice.

## Output Expectations

- Produce a breadboard document path and concise summary.
- Present complete UI and Code affordance tables.
- Include a short list of unresolved unknowns.
- Include vertical slices with demo outcomes and validation.
- Recommend the next branch/PR boundary.
